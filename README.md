# cl-ngxmpp


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grouzen/cl-ngxmpp.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/grouzen/cl-ngxmpp)

Native Common Lisp library for XMPP RFCs.

WARNING: This library is under heavy development.

# TODO:

- [X] Migrate from cl-async to blackbird library
- [X] Fix Travis-CI build
- [X] Code DSL to have more concise way to define stanzas
- [X] Re-use the brand new `define-stanza` in a definition of `define-xep` macro
- [X] Use short package nicknames instead of long names
- [X] Reorganize the structure of files and directories
- [X] Be able to represent stanzas as XML-encoded strings
- [X] Generic `print-debug` function
- [X] Write more descriptive README
- [X] *CANCELLED* Move `handle-stanza` generic method from `xmpp%` package into `xmpp`
(since, it's not a part of stanza's protocol anymore)
- [ ] *IN PROGRESS* Get rid of `send-*` methods/functions, substitute them with a `send-stanza` macro
- [X] Re-think and (it would be better) rewrite/remove a code in the `client/xeps/xeps.lisp`
- [ ] Write more XEPs (see next item)

    - [ ] *IN PROGRESS* 0045 Multi User Chat (MUC)
    - [X] 0203 Delayed Delivery
    - [X] 0004 Data Forms
    - [ ] 0077 In-Band Registration

- [ ] Figure out how to validate stanzas (xml schema is a good option I think).
Since there is no CL library for xmlschema, I can go further and try to develop one. It can be used for
stanza validation and generation, and can avoid manual work for these areas in the future.
- [ ] Add hostname verification against SSL certificate ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section-5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125))
- [ ] utility to generate stanza's id
- [ ] Revisit `core/xeps.lisp`
- [ ] Develop a high-level interface (EPIC)
- [ ] Rewrite tests using mocks
- [ ] Add more comments and code documentation
- [ ] Think about adding hooks for basic actions like: connecting, disconnecting, authenticating, etc.

      It could be represented as a set of well-defined wrappers over `xmpp%:handle-stanza` method.
      There are some number of approaches to managable, user-defined, flexible hook systems:
      global hooks, like `(add-hook 'some-hook #'(lambda () ...))`; per-session hooks.

- [ ] Asynchronous high-level interface
- [ ] Try to split out xeps/async/etc functionality into different packages
- [ ] Make an account with the name `cl-ngxmpp-say-hello-bot@someserver.foo`, then change the example of `echo-bot`
so that it says me 'hello man!', so any user of the library can send me this funny message just running the example ;)
- [ ] Develop a simple bot for conferences based on 'Markov chains' as a yet another example
    
# Architecture Overview

The XMPP constists of core and XEP parts, so the library tries to follow
the idea of extendable design incorporating several layers.

## Layers

### Low-level

A low-level code that is responsible for such things like:
connecting to server through TCP socket, making the socket secure using TLS,
SASL authentication, XML parsing, and the core set of stanzas; is in the `xmpp%` package.
So, in fact, it implements the basic blocks for the Core part of the protocol, consequently,
theoretically, it can be used to implement not only the client side but also the server side.

### High-level

High-level part is in the package `cl-ngxmpp-client` (there is `xmpp` alias for it) â€” the most
interesting part for users of the library. It hides all low-level stuff under the hood,
instead of that, it gives you well-bounded entities (futher I'll call them "domains") such as:
roster, message chat, groupchat, file transfer, etc. The basic use-case suggests reacting on
incoming events defining hooks available for particular entity. There is a simple EDSL which
allows you to define your own XEPs easily.

# Examples:

Notice! Current examples are deprecated!

You can find examples inside `src/client/examples/` directory.
First you need to load examples system:

```commonlisp
(ql:quickload :cl-ngxmpp-client.examples)
```

There is `echo-bot.lisp` example, to run it type:

```commonlisp
(cl-ngxmpp-client.examples.echo-bot:run
    :server-hostname "<your jabber server>"
    :username        "<your jabber login>"
    :password        "<your jabber password>"
    :to              "<opponent's jid>"
    :body            "<body of your message>")
```

After that bot will send the message, and will wait for messages in infinite loop.
