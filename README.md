# cl-ngxmpp


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grouzen/cl-ngxmpp.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/grouzen/cl-ngxmpp)

The native Common Lisp library for XMPP RFCs.

WARNING: This library is under heavy development.
    
# Architecture Overview

The XMPP basically constists of the core and XEP parts, the library tries to follow
an idea of an extendable design incorporating several layers.

## The Layers

### Low-level

The low-level code that is responsible for such things like:
connecting to server through TCP socket, making the socket secure using TLS,
SASL authentication, XML parsing, and the core set of stanzas; is in the `xmpp%` package.
So, in fact, it implements the basic blocks for the Core part of the protocol, consequently,
theoretically, it can be used to implement not only the client side but also the server side.

### High-level

The high-level part is in the package `cl-ngxmpp-client` (there is `xmpp` alias for it) â€” the most
interesting part for users of the library. It hides all low-level stuff under the hood,
instead of that, it gives you well-bounded entities (futher I'll call them "domains") such as:
roster, message chat, groupchat, file transfer, etc. The basic use-case suggests reacting on
incoming events defining hooks available for particular entity. There is a simple EDSL which
allows you to define your own XEPs easily.

# How To Use

## Using low-level API

You shouldn't use it, it's an internal API.

## Using intermediate-level API

The very basic example how to create a client, connect the client to a xmpp server,
log in, send a message, and wait for a response:

```commonlisp
(ql:quickload :cl-ngxmpp-client)

(let ((xmpp-client (make-instance 'xmpp:client :debuggable t)))
  (xmpp:connect-client xmpp-client :server-hostname "hostname")
  (when (connectedp xmpp-client)
    (xmpp:login-client xmpp-client
                       :username "username"
                       :password "password"
                       ;; Only PLAIN and DIGEST-MD5 mechanisms are available due to the lack
                       ;; of support for others in the cl+ssl library
                       :mechanism "PLAIN or DIGEST-MD5")
    (when (loggedinp xmpp-client)
      (xmpp:send-message xmpp-client :to "to_jid" :body "message")
      (let ((response (xmpp:receive-stanza xmpp-client)))
        ;; Here you get the instance of one of the stanza classes (see src/core/stanzas.lisp file).
        ;; Do whatever you want with it.
        (do something with the response)))))
```

Another way to handle incoming stanzas, but I wouldn't recommend using it:

```commonlisp
(ql:quickload :cl-ngxmpp-client)

;; Define a method for handling stanzas of a type of 'message'
(defmethod xmpp%:handle-stanza ((stanza xmpp%:message-stanza))
  (do something with a recieved stanza))

(let ((xmpp-client (make-instance 'xmpp:client :debuggable t)))
  (xmpp:connect-client xmpp-client :server-hostname "hostname")
  (when (connectedp xmpp-client)
    (xmpp:login-client xmpp-client
                       :username "username"
                       :password "password"
                       :mechanism "PLAIN or DIGEST-MD5")
    (when (loggedinp xmpp-client)
      (xmpp:send-message xmpp-client :to "to_jid" :body "message")
      ;; It waits for an incoming stanza, then calls an appropriate handle-stanza method.
      ;; It's something like an asynchronous interface.
      (xmpp:proceed-stanza xmpp-client)

```

In case if you miss some functionality in the core XMPP protocol and need to use certain XEPs,
you can easily turn on needed XEPs (see a list of available XEPs in src/xeps/ directory):

```commonlisp
(ql:quickload :cl-ngxmpp-client)

(xmpp:use-xeps '("multi-user-chat"
                 "in-band-registration"
                 "delayed-delivery" ...))

;; Each xep provides its own list of stanzas, these stanzas are the same as usual stanzas
;; from the core (xmpp%) package. That means that you can use them the same
;; way as you did with core stanzas.
;;
;; Attention! The way to work with XEPs can be changed in the future!

```
      
# Examples:

Notice! Current examples are deprecated!

You can find the examples inside a `src/client/examples/` directory.
First you need to load an 'examples' system:

```commonlisp
(ql:quickload :cl-ngxmpp-client.examples)
```

There is an `echo-bot.lisp` example, to run it type in REPL:

```commonlisp
(cl-ngxmpp-client.examples.echo-bot:run
    :server-hostname "<your jabber server>"
    :username        "<your jabber login>"
    :password        "<your jabber password>"
    :to              "<opponent's jid>"
    :body            "<body of your message>")
```

after that the bot will send a message to your opponent, and then will be waiting
for messages from him/her in an infinite loop.

# ToDo:

The prioritized list:

- [X] Migrate from cl-async to blackbird library
- [X] Fix the Travis-CI build
- [X] Develop a DSL to have a more concise way to define stanzas
- [X] Re-use the brand new `define-stanza` in a definition of the `define-xep` macro
- [X] Use short package nicknames instead of the long names
- [X] Reorganize the structure of files and directories
- [X] Be able to represent stanzas as XML-encoded strings
- [X] Implement a generic `print-debug` function
- [X] Make the README file more descriptive
- [X] *CANCELLED* Move the `handle-stanza` generic method from the `xmpp%` package
into the `xmpp` (since, it's not a part of the stanza protocol anymore)
- [ ] *BLOCKED* Get rid of the `send-*` methods/functions, substitute them with a `send-stanza` macro
- [X] Re-think and (it would be better) rewrite/remove some code in the `client/xeps/xeps.lisp`
- [ ] Prepare the core version of the library for getting it into the quicklisp repo

    - [X] Show usage examples
    - [ ] Merge the development and master branches to make a release
    
- [ ] Write more XEPs (see next item)

    - [ ] *IN PROGRESS* 0045 Multi User Chat (MUC)
    - [X] 0203 Delayed Delivery
    - [X] 0004 Data Forms
    - [ ] 0077 In-Band Registration

- [ ] Figure out how to validate stanzas (xml schema is a good option I guess).
Since there is no CL library for xmlschema, I can go further and try to develop one. It can be used for
stanza validation/generation, and can avoid a manual work for these areas in the future.
- [ ] Add a hostname verification against a SSL certificate ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section-5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125))
- [ ] Implement an utility to generate the stanza id
- [ ] Revisit the `core/xeps.lisp`
- [ ] Develop a high-level interface (EPIC)
- [ ] Rewrite the tests using mocks
- [ ] Add more comments and code documentation
- [ ] Think about adding hooks for the basic actions like: connecting, disconnecting, authenticating, etc.

      It could be represented as a set of well-defined wrappers over the `xmpp%:handle-stanza` method.
      There are some number of approaches to managable, user-defined, flexible hook systems:
      global hooks, e.g. `(add-hook 'some-hook #'(lambda () ...))`; per-session hooks.

- [ ] Try to split out a xeps/async/etc functionality into different packages
- [ ] Develop a simple MUC bot based on 'Markov chains' as an yet another example
